# Changelog

## Version 0.3.0 -- 2021-09-18

- Uses swift-tools 5.5 now that Xcode 13 is at a Release Candidate. This adds DocC support for this package.

## Version 0.2.1 -- 2021-06-27

### Changed

- Switched back to swift-tools 5.4. This loses DocC. Otherwise, this is compatible with release 0.2.0

## Version 0.2.0 -- 2021-06-27

### Changed

- A pretty big refactor of the APIs to strive for more fluent usage at callsites. This version is not compatable with Version 0.1.
